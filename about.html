          <p>
            The Bakers Expo, organized by Syracuse city councilor Rita Paniagua and Trita Treatz
            owner Sherita Semple, aims to promote small businesses and individual bakers who want to
            grow their businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea for the event came following a large federal grant given to CNY Arts for the
            purpose of rebuilding the Syracuse community in the wake of the pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many bakers lost their shops because of COVID-19, so Paniagua and Semple came up with
            the idea for the expo to help the community get back on its feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, years later, the project continues to grow to include an even larger audience.
